# Sound-Navigation-and-Ranging-SONAR-
Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) is a Remote Sensing System with important military, scientific and commercial applications. Active SONAR transmits acoustic (i.e., sound) waves. These waves return echoes from certain features or targets that allow the determination of important properties and attributes of the target (i.e., shape, size, speed, distance, etc.). Because electromagnetic waves are strongly attenuated (diminished) in water, RADAR signals are mostly used for ground or atmospheric observations. Because SONAR signals easily penetrate water, they are ideal for navigation and measurement under water.
